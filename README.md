# Climate Action Pledge Microsite

This is a responsive, single-page microsite built for the "Climate Action Pledge" challenge. It allows users to take a voluntary pledge for climate-positive habits, records their commitments, generates an instant digital certificate, and features them on a public "Pledge Wall" to inspire others.

The backend logic is simulated using a mock JSON data array within the JavaScript file, as per the project requirements.


## ‚ú® Features

* **Hero Section:** A clear call-to-action that smoothly scrolls to the pledge form.
* **Live KPIs:** Dynamically updating counters for "Achieved Pledges," "Students," and "Professionals."
* **Pledge Form:** A clean, responsive form with data validation and a clear privacy note.
* **Instant Certificate:** After submission, a modal-based certificate is generated with the user's name and a "coolness" rating based on the number of commitments.
* **Public Pledge Wall:** A table that dynamically populates with new pledge data (newest first).
* **Privacy First:** Email and Mobile numbers are collected but are **never** displayed on the public wall.
* **Mock Backend:** Simulates a backend using a simple JavaScript array to store and retrieve data. No server is required.
* **Fully Responsive:** A clean, mobile-first design that looks great on all devices.
